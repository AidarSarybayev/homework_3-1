# HW3.1
To complete this HW:
1) Fork this repo.
2) Add your code to the "req_historical_data" function in 
   synchronous_functions.py. Your task is to turn the 'bar' object into a 
   dataframe that plotly's candlestick function will accept. Use the 
   candlestick_plot.ipynb notebook for help in figuring this out!
3) Make reactive inputs for each of the parameters needed by 
   "req_historical_data" as indicated in Lines 106 to 110 of app.py. Don't 
   forget -- you'll need to include these new vars in the signatures of the 
   callback and the callback function!
4) Add this HW to your server at location "your url.com/homework_3.1"
